# CS-350
Morse code message via the LED using a synchronous state machine. (Project 1)

1- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving? 

Utilizing the TI Code Composer Studio (CCS), configure the TC CC3220x LAUNCHXL to use an asynchronous state machine to deliver a Morse code signal through the LED. The goal of this project is to make the green, yellow, and red LEDs located on the board's lower right corner blink. In addition, a synchronized state machine is being designed to generate a pattern of light flashing from the LEDs. The pattern in question should include a Morse code text. The Morse code signal of the flashing LEDs ought to change when a particular button is pushed.

2- What did you do particularly well?

I think I did fairly well using the switch/case, especially considering it was my first serious effort at one. It took some experimentation and error, but it all came out rather beautifully.

3- Where could you improve?

The code may have been even simpler if I had placed the inputs in the transitional arc rather than inside if statements.

4- What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I'm gaining more expertise with CCS as well as with coding the MCU. I hadn't used one until this session, so there had been a lot of instruction required. This, together with other initiatives, will be valuable to refer to in the future.

5- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Much of my knowledge of code framework, as well as my comprehension of embedded systems, will prove very beneficial in the future.

6- How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Though I have a tendency to overthink an answer, I aim to make code clear and simple to understand wherever possible. This code might be simply modified to change the needed output by adding or eliminating switches.

The thermostat project (Project 2) 

1- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project takes advantage of a variety of peripherals integrated into the board, integrating much of what was learned in class with some fresh material. It entailed converting the device's code and capabilities into an operational thermostat, where variations in temperature to the sensors on the board would trigger an LED to light up and the reading to change, emulating the activation of a heater.

2- What did you do particularly well?

After much troubleshooting and experimenting, I believe I did a good job with the code architecture and the variables I established. The code is simple to understand and adequately commented on, and the variables serve the purpose for which they were created.

3- Where could you improve?

As previously said, my tendency to overthink an answer led to me redoing this program several times. I also need to work on my grasp of how particular peripherals can be programmed.

4- What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

The conversation about asking concerns or getting explanation on the project was quite beneficial to me. Several of the comments were relevant to my knowledge of the task, and they also highlighted the importance of addressing my lecturer questions. I believe there is benefit in rebounding thoughts and inquiries off your colleagues. It is also beneficial to read the header files of the programs in use.

5- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

It was wonderful to see a sensor on the board alter the output in the terminal accompanying the LED changing. It was fascinating to observe all of these interconnected parts come together and function properly. While completing this undertaking, I began to gain a better understanding of how to program peripherals to function together, specifically mixing button clicks with customized parameters and all of this functioning with an ambient temperature sensor.

6- How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project's code is tidy and simple to understand. I used a lot of comments to describe lines of code, variables, functions, and furthermore, and I kept everything properly organized. The while function demonstrates how each timing check operates and is simple to modify or extend. It wouldn't require much effort to add additional duties, change the times, change the default settings, and so on.
